### Steps to Create Your Private Domain Email

1. **Buy a domain**  
   Register a domain from services like Namecheap, GoDaddy, or Google Domains.

2. **Set up email forwarding**  
   Use services like ImprovMX or ForwardEmail to forward mail to your real inbox.

3. **Add catch-all feature**  
   Configure a "catch-all" so any random email address under your domain works.  
   Example: anything@mydomain.com → forwards to your real inbox.

4. **Secure with filters**  
   Add filters or rules in Gmail/Outlook to keep spam away.
