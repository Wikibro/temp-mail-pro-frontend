### Social Media = Data Harvesting

Every time you sign up on **Facebook, Instagram, Twitter (X), or TikTok**, your email is linked to tracking, spam, and ads.

### Benefits of Using a Burner Email

- **Privacy Protection** – hide your real identity.  
- **Spam Control** – keep your inbox clean.  
- **Account Separation** – one burner per platform.  
- **Quick Deletion** – drop the account anytime.

### Best Practices

1. Use **different burner emails** for different platforms.  
2. Never reuse the same burner for personal + work.  
3. For long-term accounts, use a **private domain burner** instead of public temp-mail.
