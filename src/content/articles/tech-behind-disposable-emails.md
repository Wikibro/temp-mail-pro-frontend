### How Do Disposable Email Services Work?

Disposable email services let you **instantly generate an inbox** without sign-up. Here’s the tech stack:

---

### 1. **Mail Servers**
- Services run **SMTP (for receiving)** and **IMAP/POP (for reading)**.  
- Emails are accepted only for temporary domains.

### 2. **Database & Expiry**
- Emails are stored in a database.  
- Each email has a **time-to-live (TTL)** (e.g., 10 minutes → auto-delete).

### 3. **Frontend & APIs**
- Users get a **temporary inbox UI** (React, Vue, etc.).  
- Some services expose **REST APIs** so developers can fetch mails.

### 4. **Spam Protection**
- Domains are regularly rotated.  
- Blacklist/whitelist filters keep malicious use low.

### Why It Matters

Understanding the tech helps developers create **safer, more reliable disposable services**.  
It also explains why some sites **block temp-mail domains**.

✅ Now you know the hidden mechanics powering disposable email services!
